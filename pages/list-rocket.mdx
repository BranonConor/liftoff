## ListRocket

Ever needed to organize an event with your friends or family, only to find that it's impossible to get everyone on the same page? ListRocket is a tool we built to address this problem.

- Instead of everyone setting up their own todo lists across several different apps and websites, rope everyone in all in one place.
- Enjoy tailored features like Anonymous Mode, which makes for great seamless events in which gifts are involved.
